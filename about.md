Some information about you!

### More Information

I've been a software developer since dBase III.  My first real fascination with the power
of software development came with FoxPro for DOS (yes, I am that old).  I become clear to me
that developing software was my "thing."  

I have a long history with databases, and more than two decades of SQL programming.  A few
years ago, I decided to take the plunge and leave the Windows ecosystem for linux, and with
that plunge, learning an entirely new paradigm for software development.

I settled on Ruby as my scripting language of choice, and Postgres as my database.  I have
not looked back -- these are __fantastic__ tools.  Recently, though, I got hooked on 
[crystal](http://crystal-lang.org)
(the programming language, not the drug, just so we're clear).  It's a remarkable language
that has countless strengths, an amazing library, and is _fast_ since it compiles to 
native code.  See if you can find any downsides, I can't.  Well, ok, I can come up with three
minor things that may give you pause:

* It's an alpha.  But it's extremely stable; the alpha designation is more about 
the API being subject to change.
* There aren't as many libraries as there are for ruby (in crystal, they're called "shards")
* It's not well known (yet, but I'm pretty sure that's going to change)

I am so enthralled with crystal that I've decided to try writing a framework for it that makes
it easy to throw together a data-driven, fast web site.  This blog is about that effort.  I am
sure I will make mistakes that you'll laugh at, question my intelligence, and wonder "where the
hell did that idea come from?"  And in many cases, those will be perfectly valid thoughts.

Hopefully, crystal will amaze you, too.  And I hope this blog helps you learn the language.
